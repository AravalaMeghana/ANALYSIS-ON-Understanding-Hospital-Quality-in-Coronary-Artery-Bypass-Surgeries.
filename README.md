# ANALYSIS-ON-Understanding-Hospital-Quality-in-Coronary-Artery-Bypass-Surgeries Using Tableau
I am delighted to share an extensive evaluation of hospital care quality derived from rigorous research and thorough data scrutiny. The main objective of this analysis is to offer a comprehensive view of vital hospital performance measures, aiding individuals in making well-informed decisions and choose what suit’s the best concerning their healthcare options.
In this exploration of Cardiac Care data , I’ve used Tableau to generate visuals and derive key insights.

VISUAL 1: FILLED MAP OF AVERAGE CABG COUNT IN EACH STATE

VISUAL 2 : BAR GRAPH OF AVERAGE CABG CASES AND MORTALITY OF EACH HOSPITALS IN EACH STATE.

VISUAL 3 : TEXT TABLE OF HOSPITAL AND THEIR STAR RATING BY PUBLIC.

VISUAL 4: LINE GRAPH OF CABG COUNT AND MORTALITY RATE BASED ON HOSPITAL RATINGS IN EACH STATE.

DASHBOARD: COMBINATION OF ALL THESE VISUALIZATIONS

The analysis aimed to provide valuable insights into hospitals' performance in delivering coronary artery bypass graa (CABG) surgeries. Leveraging data from multiple sources, this study facilitated informed decision-making for both potentiaal patieents seeking cardiac care and healthcare authoritieses responsible for service improvements.
